# Intro

## About

This is a compatibility layer that allows [`onion/framework`](https://phonion.github.io/framework/) based applications to run on the [swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/) library.

Due to the extensible nature of the Onion framework, this package can be integrated with
minimal configuration changes into any existing application giving it a large performance
boost.

## Requirements

Since this is an extension package to `onion/framework` the major requirements
come from it, with the only addition of `ext-swoole`.
